# Sentiment Chatbot Project
This is a Sentiment Analysis Chatbot that listens to user input, analyzes the sentiment, and provides a response based on the sentiment polarity. It uses the `TextBlob` library for sentiment analysis and `SpeechRecognition` for voice input.
 Installation
Follow these steps to install and run the chatbot on your local machine:
 1. Install Python dependencies:
First, install the necessary libraries. Open your terminal and run the following commands:
bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio textblob tkinter
2.Run the chatbot:
After installing the dependencies, run the chatbot using:
bash
CopyEdit
python chatbot.py
Usage:
1. Upon running the program, the chatbot will open a GUI.
2. Click on the "Analyze Sentiment" button, and the chatbot will listen to your voice.
3. It will then analyze the sentiment and provide a response based on the detected sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
Improvements:
* Improve the chatbot's responses for more personalized interactions.
* Add more advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for better sentiment analysis.
* Implement speech-to-text functionality for different languages.
* Improve error handling for unrecognized speech.

### 2?? **Testing & Debugging**

You need to ensure your chatbot works correctly with various inputs. Here's how you can proceed:

#### Steps:
1. **Test Different Inputs**:
    - Try using different types of input: positive, negative, and neutral phrases.
    - Test noisy or unclear speech to see how the chatbot handles speech recognition errors.
  
    Example test cases:
    - Positive: "I am feeling great today!"
    - Negative: "I had a really bad day."
    - Neutral: "I am doing okay, not bad."

2. **Bug Fixing**:
    - If the chatbot doesn’t respond as expected, print debug messages to understand what’s wrong.
    - Check if the microphone captures the speech correctly or if `SpeechRecognition` is working fine.
    - Ensure that `TextBlob` returns correct sentiment scores. If it's not, check for API limitations or incorrect handling of inputs.

3. **Improve Responses**:
    - Right now, the responses are simple based on sentiment polarity. You can add more sophisticated response generation or make it interactive.
    - For example, you can make the chatbot respond differently to different positive/negative inputs like "I am so happy!" vs "I'm okay."

Example:
```python
def analyze_sentiment():
    user_input = recognize_speech()
    sentiment_score = TextBlob(user_input).sentiment.polarity

    if sentiment_score > 0.5:
        response = "Wow, you're really happy! ??"
    elif sentiment_score > 0:
        response = "That's positive! Keep up the good mood! ??"
    elif sentiment_score < -0.5:
        response = "Oh no, seems like you're upset. ??"
    elif sentiment_score < 0:
        response = "I'm sorry you're feeling down. ??"
    else:
        response = "That's neutral. Would you like to talk more?"

    output_label.config(text=response)

3?? Deploy the Chatbot as a Web Application
You can convert your chatbot into a web application using Flask and deploy it online using services like Streamlit, Heroku, or AWS. I'll guide you through Flask and Streamlit deployments.
Step 1: Convert the chatbot into a Flask web app
Flask is a lightweight web framework that will allow you to serve your chatbot as a web application.
1. Install Flask: Open your terminal and run:
bash
CopyEdit
pip install Flask
2. Create a Flask app: Create a new file app.py and add the following code:
python
CopyEdit
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from textblob import TextBlob
import speech_recognition as sr

app = Flask(__name__)

def recognize_speech():
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    try:
        return recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        return "Sorry, I couldn't understand that."

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])
def analyze():
    user_input = recognize_speech()
    sentiment_score = TextBlob(user_input).sentiment.polarity

    if sentiment_score > 0:
        response = "That sounds positive! ??"
    elif sentiment_score < 0:
        response = "Oh no, that seems negative. ?? I'm here to help!"
    else:
        response = "That's quite neutral. ?? Tell me more."
    
    return response

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
3. Create HTML for the web page: Create a folder named templates, and inside it, create a file called index.html:
html
CopyEdit
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Sentiment Chatbot</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Sentiment Chatbot</h1>
    <p>Click the button to speak to the chatbot!</p>
    <form action="/analyze" method="POST">
        <button type="submit">Analyze Sentiment</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
4. Run the Flask app: In your terminal, run:
bash
CopyEdit
python app.py
This will start a local web server. Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to interact with the chatbot.
Step 2: Deploy the app on Streamlit, Heroku, or AWS
1. Streamlit:
o First, install Streamlit: pip install streamlit
o Create a file called streamlit_app.py with your chatbot code.
o Run streamlit run streamlit_app.py.
o Streamlit will automatically generate a link to access your app.
2. Heroku:
o Set up a Procfile and follow Heroku deployment documentation for Flask apps.
o Deploy the Flask app on Heroku after creating an account and linking it to your GitHub repository.
3. AWS:
o You can use Elastic Beanstalk or Lightsail to deploy the Flask app to AWS.
o AWS provides an easy-to-use interface to deploy Python applications.

With these steps, you'll have successfully finalized and deployed your chatbot project!
